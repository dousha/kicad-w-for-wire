# kicad-w-for-wire

I just really need to press `w` to place wire.

## Motivation

Since KiCAD 6, when pressing `w` twice, it won't place wire for you. 
Instead, a nagging bar whould show to tell you to press `Esc` to end 
placing wire.

This is not tolerable for me -- not just for me, for everyone who 
cannot easily press the mouse button. You know, maybe they are on 
laptops without a mouse plugged in. Maybe they have difficulty clicking 
the mouse. Or maybe they just don't like the idea of mouse clicking.

I could have rolled back to KiCAD 5. But I don't like the idea of 
using a legacy version of an actively developing software.

So I set myself to write a program to bring this feature back.

## How To Use

TBD
